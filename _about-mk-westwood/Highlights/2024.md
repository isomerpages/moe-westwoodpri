### **2024**
#### **MK Open House 2024**

Open House 2024 was held on 17 February where we welcomed parents to tour the MK learning environment and speak to the MK educators in person. Through games and presentations focusing on our holistic curriculum, parents were provided with a first-hand experience on why MK is the quality preschool choice and how we ignite the joy of learning in our children!
