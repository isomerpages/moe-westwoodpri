### **Our Strategic Plans**
#### **A Journey to be Exceptional**
As a new school in the 21st century, Westwood Primary School aspires to be **Exceptional** by offering a student-centric, values-driven education for our pupils. This is premised on designing and delivering a **Holistic Education**, anchored on sound character development and values inculcation, to prepare our pupils to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world. At the same time, it is important for us to maintain a focus on nurturing the future-oriented child so that our pupils can possess lifelong competencies like innovative thinking, cross-cultural understanding and resilience to seize opportunities and **Thrive** in a globalized world. This calls for us to place important emphasis on imparting both skills and competencies and to **teach well-being**, and for our pupils to gain greater insights of the self as an agent for change and knowledge creation. To this end, we have embarked on the journey to explore how **Positive Education** can guide us in developing learning-teaching practices, designing our curriculum and shaping our school culture and overall strategic directions.

#### **Our Next Lap**

In 2021, under the Leadership of our second Principal, Mr Andrew Mah, Westwood Primary School embarked on reviewing and refreshing our Vision, Mission and Strategic Directions. After a series of focused group discussions with staff, students, parents and stakeholders on what we envision a Westwoodian to be like after six years of experiencing a **Uniquely Westwood Experience**, our Strategic Plan for our next lap was conceptualized and launched. The refreshed directions sharpens Westwood’s focus on continuing our **Innovation** in developing a Holistic, **Student-Centric Academic Curriculum** as well as synergizing various MOE initiatives and school-based innovations into a cohesive **Character Education** Programme centering on MOE’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) 2021 curriculum and our **Positive Education** Programme.


#### **Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats Analysis**
School leaders, together with the management team, undertook a SWOT analysis to list the key strengths to build on, key weaknesses to minimize, opportunities to leverage on and threats to address. In line with our Vision, Mission and Values, 3 Strategic Thrusts were developed.
