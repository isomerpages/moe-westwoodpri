### **Our Strategic Plans**
#### **A Journey to be Exceptional**
As a new school in the 21st century, we aspire to be exceptional by offering a student-centric, values-driven education for our pupils. This is premised on designing and delivering a holistic education, anchored on sound character development and values inculcation, to prepare our pupils to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world. At the same time, our focus needs to be nurturing the future-oriented child so that our pupils can possess lifelong competencies like innovative thinking, cross-cultural understanding and resilience to take full advantage of opportunities in a globalized world. This calls for us to place important emphasis on imparting both skills and competencies and to teach well-being, and for our pupils to gain greater insights of the self as an agent for change and knowledge creation. To this end, we have embarked on the journey to explore how Positive Education can guide us in developing learning-teaching practices, designing our curriculum and shaping our school culture and overall strategic directions.

Our SEM Journey

#### **Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats Analysis**
School leaders, together with the management team, undertook a SWOT analysis to list the key strengths to build on, key weaknesses to minimize, opportunities to leverage on and threats to address. In line with our Vision, Mission and Values, 3 Strategic Thrusts were developed.
