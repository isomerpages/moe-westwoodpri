### **School Crest**

<img src="/images/crest.gif" style="width:35%">

Our school crest depicts a figure of a huge tree formed by six small trees, representing the six year-levels within the school. It also symbolizes how we are all unique as individuals, yet united as a community.

The base trees in light-green signify our Passion for Community. The middle trees remind us to always embrace a Heart of Gratitude and a Resilient Mindset. The tallest tree in dark-green is a symbol for all to possess a Future-ready Confidence, to move together as one into our desired future. These are the four character strengths we aspire to imbue in all of us in Westwood Primary.  

Illustrated by upward-pointing arrowheads which are securely bound together, the crest also aptly reflects our school motto Future-ready, Anchor-steady. Our school name is in teal and brown, which are contrasting colours of the giant redwood trees, as our inspiration to thrive and be exceptional.
