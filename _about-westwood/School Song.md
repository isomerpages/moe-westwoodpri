### **School Song**
#### **Lyrics**
Boys and girls of Westwood primary<br>
we are destined to lead<br>
with character strength and a steady anchor<br>
the future is in our hands
 
Teachers, pupils, united in harmony<br>
together we strive for the best<br>
Though life may put us through the test<br>
Westwood will never fret 
  
(Chorus)<br>
Live our dreams! We believe<br>
Westwood primary will achieve<br>
Moving forward, set the standard<br>
Westwood shall stand tall<br>
Live our dreams! We believe<br>
Westwood primary will achieve<br>
Moving forward, set the standard<br>
Westwood shall stand tall!
