### **The Westwood Story**

<img src="/images/Westwood%20Story.jpg" style="width:85%">

Westwood Primary aspires to tell a redwood story in Jurong West. Located in a now vibrant estate which was once a swampy land, this new school is built to thrive and to be exceptional, just like the world’s most ancient sequoias, which live up to 3,000 years and can be as tall as 27 storeys.

Redwoods have a strong network of roots that reach out and provide support for one another as they grow. Similarly, the Westwood community speaks of interconnections among the school staff, families and our pupils who are strongly bound by authentic relationships and a shared compact, to flourish and be an inspiration.
