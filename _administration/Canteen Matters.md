### **Canteen Matters**
Health has always been an important aspect of a child’s holistic development. To support the holistic development of our pupils, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) have been working closely with schools to implement the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP) to promote healthy eating among the children in all schools The objective of the programme is to help schools build a supportive environment to promote healthier eating. The programme provides schools with a set of food service guidelines that aim to reduce the amount of fat, salt and sugar in food preparation, as well as encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables, and wholegrains.

For more information on the programme, please visit the HMSP webpage.

#### **Healthy Meals in School Programme(HMSP)**
In line with promoting a safe and healthy school, our school has joined the HMSP since 2015. The School Canteen Committee works closely with our canteen stallholders to ensure the adoption of hygienic food preparation methods, the provision of healthier food options and the sale of food at reasonable and affordable prices to pupils and staff. Meetings are held regularly to check in with stall owners on quality and quantity of food provided and provide two-way feedback.

Under this programme, our canteen vendors will also need to follow food service guidelines which includes:  
* Cutting down fat, sugar and salt.
* Serving whole grains, fruits and vegetables
* Serving healthy set meals

These meals incorporate food from the four main food groups – brown rice and wholemeal bread, meat and others, vegetables and fruit. These help students to receive the appropriate nutrients necessary for their growing needs.

There are 8 food stalls in the school canteen.
