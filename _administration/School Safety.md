#### **Safety Tips for Participation in Sports & Game**
Participation in sports and games has immense benefits for people across ages. For the case of children and youths, sports provide the unique opportunity for participants to increase their physical activity and develop pertinent social and physical skills.

As with all physical activities, sporting or otherwise, there is always an inherent element of risk. As such, one should always ensure that these risks are minimized before the start of each activity. In many instances, accidents and injuries could be avoided if one adheres to safety practices.

The following list of safety tips and practices will guide you before, during and after the participation of sports and games.

#### **Before the start of the sport/game**
*   If you have a medical condition, check with your doctor if the sport/game is suitable for you.
*   Do not participate in the sport/game if you are injured/feeling unwell/on medication/recovering from an illness.
*   Do not exercise on a full stomach. Food should be consumed well before the start of a game.
*   Check the weather conditions. Do not train or play outdoors if there is poor air quality, extreme heat or lightning risks.
*   Put on appropriate attire.  
*   Consider the use of sunscreen to prevent overexposure to the sun.  
*   Hydrate yourself adequately by drinking water half an hour before the exercise.  
*   Check all personal protective gear (e.g. helmets, shin guards) and equipment (e.g. racquet, shoes) to ensure that they are in good working condition. 
*   Remove all hard/sharp objects and accessories (e.g. necklaces, ear studs, rings).  
*   Check that the playing environment (e.g. field, indoor court) is free from litter, and hazards (e.g. sharp objects, wet flooring) are removed/cleared before the start of the sport/game.
