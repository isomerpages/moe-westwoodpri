### **English Language, Drama and Debating**
#### **Brief Description of CCA**
English Language, Drama and Debating aims at fostering a love for the English Language through the wide spectrum of literary activities. Pupils will have a chance to put up Readers Theatre performances and skits for school wide events. These opportunities enable pupils to learn the skills of speaking, reading and presenting in a fun and engaging manner.

With the advent of technology, pupils will learn how to create e-books using ICT tools as well as basic voice recording using iPads.

The CCA will also be introducing a debate module that is suitable for children with no debate background. It aims to encourage critical thinking, foster effective communication and build teamwork.
