### **The Young Student Programme (TYS)**

#### **Introduction**

The Young Student Programme (TYS) was established in 2013 to provide selected lower primary students with meaningful learning experiences that enhance their confidence and curiosity. The programme features a variety of engaging activities, including coding workshop conducted by the boys from Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) and interactive storytelling sessions by adult volunteers. There are also opportunities for students to use iPads to explore educational apps like Kahoot and Koobits. Additionally, enriching learning journeys are organised to provide hands-on experiences beyond the classroom.
