Modern Dance is a dynamic and expressive art form that communicates feelings and ideas through purposeful, rhythmic and captivating movements. More than just a typical dance CCA, Modern Dance blends elements of modern dance, jazz, ballet and ethnic influences, creating a unique and versatile experience for our pupils. Through exposure to various dance genres, students not only develop their technical skills but also foster teamwork, collaboration and effective communication. Be sure to catch our vibrant Modern Dance performers in action, as they bring energy and passion to every stage with their stunning and unforgettable performances!
