### **Maker Education**
#### **Maker Education@Westwood**
Maker Education in Westwood has created opportunities for our pupils to develop their potential, foster human flourishing and cultivate confident and innovative pupils across the levels. It started with the opening of the Makerspace@Westwood which provides a learning space for all pupils to explore and work on self-initiated projects during their free time at recess. The creations of these young makers would then be show-cased at Westwood’s annual Maker Fiesta. Over the years, we have conducted many exciting activities, programmes and workshops to infuse the joy of learning, learning for life and to promote entrepreneurial dare.
