#### **Curricular Objectives**
English is the common language that facilitates bonding amongst the different ethnic and cultural groups in Singapore. At the global level, English allows Singaporeans to tap into a knowledge-based economy where English is the main lingua franca of the Internet, of Science and Technology and of World Trade.

The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.
