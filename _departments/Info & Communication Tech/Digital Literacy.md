<img src="/images/dl1.png" style="width:65%">

In Westwood Primary, the Digital Literacy programme comprises of **ICT Baseline Standards, ICT Enrichment, Cyber Wellness** and **Media Literacy**. Our ICT Baseline Standards is integrated with Project Work under our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), which is aligned to the school’s Thrive Framework to **develop future-ready and responsible digital learners.**

#### **Overview of ICT Baseline Literacy Programme**
Our Baseline ICT Standard Literacy Programme and Project Work aim to equip every Westwood pupil with the essential ICT skills for the 21st Century, to become self-directed and collaborative learners. We will be showcasing our pupils’ work by levels via this Google Site. You are strongly encouraged to take a look at your child’s/ward’s work and write some “Words of Encouragement” for him/her using the Padlet links. We hope this will help parents better understand their child/ward’s learning in school. Partner us in nurturing our pupils to be future-ready and anchor-steady.
