#### **Curricular Objectives**
The ICT Department seeks to develop future-ready and responsible digital learners through our ICT integration in curriculum and Digital Literacy programme.

#### **The ICT Experience @ Westwood!**
The ICT Experience@Westwood is a programme through which every pupil will be equipped with the fundamental ICT skills to be a future-ready, anchor-steady individual. Through the Baseline ICT Standard Literacy Programme, pupils will be equipped with the essential ICT skills for the 21st Century and learn to be self-directed and collaborative learners. With the increasing use of technology in schools and homes, cyber wellness is aimed to develop pupils’ instinct to protect himself and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being while in cyberspace.

#### **Cyberwellness**
The Cyber Wellness programme in Westwood uses the Sense-Think-Act approach to develop a child’s instinct to act responsibly in cyber space. This is based on three guiding principles: ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and 'Positive Peer Influence'.

#### **Our Approach Partnership**
Partnership with parents to support them in understanding cyber wellness issues and risks, as well as involving parents in reinforcing cyber wellness principles at home could ensure a more effective inculcation of these principles in pupils.

#### **Integrating Cyber Wellness Core Values into Curriculum**
*   Leveraging on Assembly and 21st&nbsp;&nbsp;CC as a platform to share key messages in Cyber Wellness.  
    
*   Leveraging on Character and Citizen Education (CCE) to inculcate the right values in cyberspace.
