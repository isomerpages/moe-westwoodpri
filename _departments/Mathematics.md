#### **Vision**
Every Westwood pupil is to be a future-ready, anchor-steady Mathematical problem solver

#### **Curricular Objectives**
The Mathematics Department seeks to enable students to
*   acquire the necessary Mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life;  
*   make effective use of a variety of mathematical tools in the learning and application of the subject; and  
*   develop positive attitudes as they learn to reason logically, communicate Mathematically and learn cooperatively and independently.  
    
We believe that early success in Mathematics is crucial for developing interest and intrinsic motivation. We hope that pupils will have a strong foundation in Mathematics and steadily acquire higher-order mathematical skills in order to achieve excellence.
