#### **Curricular Objective**
The Mother Tongue Language Department seeks to develop competent Mother Language learners through instilling greater ownership of&nbsp;learning, as well as developing pupils' appreciation and promoting their interest in the learning of Mother Tongue Language and Culture. We believe that every child should strive to excel in the daily use and application of the Mother Tongue Language. Since 2022, we have been offering Higher Mother Tongue Language from Primary 3 to Primary 6. This allows more students to deepen their knowledge and appreciation for these languages and their cultures from an early age. We hope this will encourage students with strong interest and aptitude in Mother Tongue Languages to learn as high a level as they can.
