#### **PE Curriculum @ Westwood**
Physical Education (PE) for Lower Primary pupils focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in pupils’ performance.

Physical Education (PE) for Upper Primary pupils focuses on more complex combinations of discrete skills and sequences of movements. Pupils also get to join SwimSafer programme to learn about water safety and swimming skills.

Physical Health &amp; Fitness (PHF) is explicitly taught via the Health Education (HE) journal, ‘An Active &amp; Healthy Me’. It provides an insight of good health practices in exercise, safety and hygiene. It also encourages pupils’ interest in physical activity through meaningful experiential learning.

Play@Recess programmes ensure that pupils get opportunities every day to play, stretch and be active.&nbsp;Pupils can use this opportunities to strengthen their bond with their peers.
