#### **Learning Outcome**
Every Westwood pupil will become an inquisitive learner through the acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills and show care and concern for the environment.

#### **Curricular Objectives**
The Science department seeks to prepare our students to be effective citizens with the ability to function and thrive in an increasingly technologically - driven world.  Central to the Science curriculum framework is the spirit of scientific inquiry. The Science curriculum seeks to nurture each student as an inquirer, fueling each child’s natural curiosity. 

In 2021/2022, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)  programs designed to help students gain skills required to succeed in the 21st-century have been introduced into the curriculum at different levels. These programmes incorporate a wide range of soft skills such as critical thinking, innovative problem-solving, team-work, adaptability, creativity, digital literacy, etc. 

Ultimately, we hope to develop pupils who  are innovative, enjoy Science and value scientific inquiry as an important tool to help them explore their natural and physical world.
