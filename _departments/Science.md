#### **Learning Outcome**
Every Westwood pupil will become an inquisitive learner through the acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills and show care and concern for the environment.

#### **Curricular Objectives**
The Science department seeks to prepare our students to be effective citizens with the ability to function and thrive in an increasingly technologically - driven world.&nbsp; Central to the Science curriculum framework is the spirit of scientific inquiry. The Science curriculum seeks to nurture each student as an inquirer, fueling each child’s natural curiosity.&nbsp;

In 2021/2022, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)&nbsp; programs designed to help students gain skills required to succeed in the 21st-century have been introduced into the curriculum at different levels. These programmes incorporate a wide range of soft skills such as critical thinking, innovative problem-solving, team-work, adaptability, creativity, digital literacy, etc.&nbsp;

Ultimately, we hope to develop pupils who&nbsp; are innovative, enjoy Science and value scientific inquiry as an important tool to help them explore their natural and physical world.
