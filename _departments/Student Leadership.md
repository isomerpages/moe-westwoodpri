#### **Curricular Objectives**
The Westwood Primary Positive Learning for Life Programme seeks to develop our students to be Student Advocates, demonstrating the attributes of a self-directed learner, confident person, concerned citizen and compassionate leader. We encourage our Student Leaders to lead their peers in serving the school and the community.

#### **Brief Overview**
WWPS has been aligning the criteria and development journey of a Student Leader to the school’s THRIVE Framework:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Thinking Mindfully | - I set out to learn something new every day.<br>- I know that with effort, I can improve. |
| Healthy Coping | - I keep trying at all times.<br>- I will continue to believe in others and myself even when we face setbacks. |
| Relating Well | - I work well with others and appreciate the differences we have.<br>- I can be trusted to do what I said I would do. |
|  In The Moment | - I reach my goals despite all challenges.<br>- I am able to learn and adapt in every situation. |
|  Values-driven Action | - I step forward to lead my friends with a gracious heart.<br>- I lead and serve with my hearts.   |
|

#### **Student Council Exco being the Apex of WWPS Pupil Leaders**

Every year, WWPS holds a Student Leaders Investiture Ceremony at the beginning of Term 3 to officially appoint deserving Student Leaders as Prefects, Peer Support Leaders and/or CCA Leaders. These newly-appointed Student Leaders have been selected by their previous and current year Form Teachers, Subject Teachers and the core Student Leadership Team for exemplifying and role-modelling the following values:

*   Good Conduct
*   Character Strengths
*   Community Involvement
*   Responsibility
*   Integrity
*   Leadership Quality

The school’s Prefectorial Board’s Structure comprises these different levels:<br>
Level 1: Acting Prefects&nbsp;<br>
Level 2: Junior Prefects (P3)<br>
Level 3: Prefects (P4)<br>
Level 4: Senior Prefects (P5 &amp; P6)
