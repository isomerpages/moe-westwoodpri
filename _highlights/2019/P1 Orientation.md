### **P1 Orientation**
Westwood Primary School welcomed our 8th batch of Primary One pupils on Saturday, 2 Nov 2019. It was a wonderful day for everyone as the young children got to meet their teachers and new friends for the first time. Pupils went for a short school tour, took their very first class photo and took part in some activities in class.
