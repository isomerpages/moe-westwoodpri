### **P6 Parents' Briefing on S1 Options**
 We invited Mr Sherwin Cheng, Principal of Swiss Cottage Secondary to share his insights on Primary to Secondary Transition for our pupils to our parents, so that our parents can use the information to transit their child to other secondary schools. We wish our P6 pupils all the best in their future endeavours.

Dear parents, please also note that PSLE results will be released on Thursday 21 November at 11 am. Our pupils are to be at the school hall by 11 am that morning.

Please click on the PDF document below to view the S1 posting information from the sharing session.<br>
