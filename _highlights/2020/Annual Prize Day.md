### **Annual Prize Day**
We celebrated Westwood 9th Prize Day 2021 on 19 November 2021 with fanfare despite the Safe Management Measures in place. Our annual Prize Day serves to recognise the progress and achievements of Westwoodians who have put in commendable efforts in their academic learning and have shown excellence in their holistic and character development.

In our eyes, every Westwoodian is already a winner for having the grit and positivity to adapt to the changes brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. We wish all our pupils well as 2021 draws to a close. Stay positive and healthy and we will see you in 2022!
