### **Commemorating Total Defence Day**
Total Defence Day was commemorated on 10 Feb 2020 with the theme “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. A skit titled ‘Together We Defend’ was live-streamed to pupils who remained in their respective classrooms for the assembly programme. The skit reminded pupils that the task of nation-building required everyone’s effort so that we can preserve Singapore’s prosperity and stability. 

During recess, the pupils observed ‘Meat-Free Day’ to experience the scarcity of food options during crisis or war as well as to understand the importance of being prepared during times of emergency. To deepen pupils' understanding of Total Defence Day, interactive booths were set up by five uniformed groups from Westwood Secondary School. Pupils enjoyed the hands-on activities, which included life-skills and first-aid demonstrations.

Our teachers also guided the pupils through the wipedown routine where pupils clean up their own eating spaces in the canteen to ensure others have clean tables to use. This was done in conjunction with a nation-wide movement to inculcate new social norms for hygiene and social consciousness. Pupils are constantly reminded that together, we play a part to build national resilience. Together, We Keep Singapore Strong!
