### **Inter House Westwood Challenge**
To promote sportsmanship and camaraderie among Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils, Westwood Primary School held her annual Inter-House Sports Carnival. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, pupils were trained in 3 events during PE lessons: basketball, football and skipping. After two weeks of training, pupils embarked on an intense 2-week competition. Every point each pupil scored during PE lessons contributed to the overall House scores. Pupils were given the opportunity to watch the “live scores” of each House displayed in the Canteen during recess. After weeks of participation by our pupils and nail biting competition, the Future Ready Foxes emerged as the champion for IHWC 2021 with the other houses trailing by narrow margins.
