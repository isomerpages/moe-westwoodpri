### **National Day Celebration**
This year, Singapore celebrates her 56th National Day with the theme, ‘Together, Our Singapore Spirit’. On 6th August 2021, Westwood Primary School commemorated Singapore’s 56 years of independence with a class-based celebration in view of the Safe Management Measures put in place.  

The day started with a live telecast of the awaited Observance Ceremony, showcasing our pupil-led marching contingent who held up our Singapore flag with pride. The marching contingent comprises of 6 pupils from various CCA groups representing the 6 arms of Singapore’s defense. The Singapore Spirit was clearly demonstrated as rest of the school community watched attentively from the various classrooms. Following which, we listened to a video recording of the National Day Message by our Minister for Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing   

After the recollections, we watched a video compilation of the Staff Maker Challenge which also reflected the unity of our Westwoodian Community. We used recycled materials to capture what we personally felt was the Singapore Spirit. This sense of togetherness was further enhanced when all of us participated in the Get Active SG workout which reminded all to take good care of their health by leading an active lifestyle. Our PE Teachers also put together a special dance video featuring our School Leaders, teachers and support staff dancing together. The celebration ended on a high note with all the exciting class-based activities which included the maker challenges for all pupils. 

As a nation, we have continuously overcome many challenges together as one. The world may look different today but we strongly believe that with a positive mindset and by working together, Singapore can overcome all challenges and emerge stronger, just like we have done before!
