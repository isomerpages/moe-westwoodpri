### **P1 Orientation**
Westwood Primary School welcomed our 9th batch of Primary One pupils on Saturday, 7 Nov 2020 via a webinar. During this session, our Principal and Vice-Principals conducted a briefing for parents on School matters followed by a virtual meeting via Zoom with the 2021 Primary One Form Teachers. It was exciting for our newest members to the Westwood Family as they got to see their classmates for the first time! This was yet another milestone for WWPS as we conducted a very successful virtual P1 Orientation for the first time! We look forward to seeing everyone again on the first day of school in 2021!
