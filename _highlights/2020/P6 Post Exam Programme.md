A series of Primary 6 Post Exam activities on the theme - A Moment in Westwood, A Lifetime of Memories were planned for our Primary 6 2020 Graduating Cohort this year.  Pupils were involved in Project Work on designing class posters for the Primary 6 Legacy Wall and Graduation Yearbook. Through this project work, they worked closely with their peers, developing Character Strengths of Creativity, Social intelligence, Teamwork and Gratitude. Through this programme, pupils developed positive emotions as well as stronger relationships with their teachers and with one another. The whole series of programmes were then concluded with a Graduation Level Fiesta on Positive Education.
