### **Teacher's Day Showcase & Celebrations**
The Aesthetics Department organized the ‘Westwood Superstar’ to provide a platform for our pupils to showcase their talents in the performing arts. We were very proud to see how the pupils found new ways to get around the constraints and challenges faced during the pandemic to display their creativity and wonderful musical talents. Our pupils put up artistic performances for our virtual Teachers’ Day Celebrations 2021. We were especially thankful to have Member of Parliament for West Coast GRC (Ayer Rajah-Gek Poh), Ms Foo Mee Har, and School Advisory Committee Chairperson, Mr Raymond Goh, to join us in our celebrations to spur us on in these challenging times. The heartfelt appreciation video by the PSG further uplifted our day.
