### **Children's Day Celebration**
**Children's Day Celebration on 22 October 2021**

Home-based Learning did not dampen our spirits as we celebrated Children’s Day online with our individual classes. Pupils had the opportunity to catch up with their classmates, and were treated to a morning workout. This was followed by an e-Concert “Choose Hope - Let’s Do It Together!” featuring pupil voices on what hope means to them, a Hip Hop Assembly, dedications, as well as learning about self-care and caring for others through a skit by our Parent Support Group and a video on building a more inclusive society with Community Chest. The e-Celebrations ended on a high note with our teachers hosting an exciting game for pupils!
