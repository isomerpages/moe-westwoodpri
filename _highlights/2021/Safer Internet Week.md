### **Safer Internet Week**
Safer Internet week was carried out in Term 1 Week 9 this year! The theme for this year was, "Together for a better Internet", set by the Media Literacy Council. The week showcased the good work carried out by our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors from Primary 4 to 6. Our pupil ambassadors advocated an annual global initiative that promotes the safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology during the PRAM sessions and at recess with their peers in school. Many interesting activities were planned by our pupil ambassadors to help their peers understand how they can become safe and responsible users on the Internet. Moving forward, we also hope our pupils will in time to come be useful contributors to the Internet too.
