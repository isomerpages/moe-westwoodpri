### **Breakfast with P1 Parents**
**Breakfast with P1 Parents**

With the easing of the Safe Management Measures, our school organised the "Breakfast with P1 Parents" event from 18 to 20 May 2022 to create time and space for parent-child bonding while allowing the school to build stronger relationships with the parents. With Pupil Well-Being and Positivity in mind, our parents spent a precious half an hour having breakfast with their children in the canteen hosted by the Vice Principal, Year Head and Assistant Year Head over three days in small cozy groups.
