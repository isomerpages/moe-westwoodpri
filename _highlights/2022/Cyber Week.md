### **Cyber Week**
In the 6th week of Term 2, Westwood Primary held our Cyber Week and embarked on a journey towards being a concerned and informed Digital Citizen. Through a series of situational videos and games prepared by our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors and teachers, students learned how to protect themselves when venturing through Cyberspace. A poster design and coloring competition was held to consolidate their learning and the winners were given the title of ‘Stars of Cyber Wellness’.
