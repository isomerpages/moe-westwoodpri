### **Teacher's Day Showcase & Celebrations**
With a hiatus of 2 years, “Westwood Superstar” is back! Together with the Staff Well-being Committee, the Aesthetics Department organized the ‘Westwood Superstar’ to provide a platform for our pupils to showcase their talents in the performing arts. This year, we had the privilege of having the MK pupils and teachers joining us for the celebration. Pupil finalists, MK pupils and the Parent Support Group put up performances that wow-ed the audiences. The hall was packed with enthusiastic audience and aren’t we grateful for the wonderful performances! After the celebrations, we welcome back the alumni, it was heartening to see the alumni coming back to visit the teachers!
