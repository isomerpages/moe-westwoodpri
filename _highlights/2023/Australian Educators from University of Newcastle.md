### **Australian Educators from University of Newcastle**

Westwood Primary hosted a group of student teachers from University of Newcastle (Australia) on 25 May 2023. They had a valuable opportunity to enhance their understanding of our school's Positive Education approach and teaching methods. Additionally, they had an enlightening exchange with our students from Westwood.
