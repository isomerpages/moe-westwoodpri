### **Celebration of Positivity**

On the 14th of November, we embraced the 'Celebration of Positivity', a day dedicated to fostering a spirit of creativity and critical thinking among our pupils. This event aimed to ignite the joy of learning through hands-on experiences. Each level of students was given an engaging maker task that challenged their creativity and problem-solving skills. From designing intricate Lego structures to crafting personalized badges, tote bags, and name cards, the activities fostered a collaborative learning environment as pupils revisited the character strengths they had learned during the Thrive lessons.
