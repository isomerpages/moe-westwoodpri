### **Children's Day Celebration**

This year, our Children's Day celebration embraced the theme 'I Can Be….' In addition to a fantastic dance performance by a group of P5 students, our teachers added to the excitement by taking part in a delightful fashion Contest, where they dressed up as their favorite characters during the concert. The day was made even more thrilling with the inclusion of a photo booth and song dedications during recess. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Parent Support Group for joining us in making this day extra special for our children!
