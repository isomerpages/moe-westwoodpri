### **Deepavali Celebration**

Our pupils were immersed in the vibrant spirit of Deepavali on 10 November 2023. Cheers of joy filled the air during the celebration as pupils were enchanted by soulful songs, and the mesmerizing Hindu dance moves by our teachers lifted everyone's spirits high. It was a celebration where music and dance united, leaving everyone in awe.

Another highlight of the celebration was the immersive inter-food cultural learning experience about Putu Mayam for P4 pupils. Our CCE ambassadors led the event by sharing the history of Putu Mayam and how it evolved as one of our favorite cultural foods. They also provided insights into the dos and don'ts of using fingers while eating. With that, the food tasting began. Together, we celebrated harmony in diversity!
