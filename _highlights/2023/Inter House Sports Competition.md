### **Inter-House Sports Competition**

This year, we welcome back our esteemed alumni to take the lead in organizing the Inter-House Sports Competition. Their support has been invaluable, and we are deeply grateful for their commitment to our school community. It was not only an opportunity for our Westwood pupils to engage in friendly competition and win points for their houses, but also a chance for them to learn from and be inspired by our accomplished alumni. The day was filled with excitement and camaraderie as students participated in various games, cheering for their friends and showcasing their sportsmanship. At the end of the competition, the coveted title went to our Future-Ready Foxes!
