### **Japanese School Visit**

Our friends from Japan visited Westwood Primary on 23 March 2023. They were hosted by our Primary 5 students for lesson experiences and school tour. 

It was a great learning experience for both our friends and Westwood students. Through this valuable interaction, students have learned more about one another's culture.
