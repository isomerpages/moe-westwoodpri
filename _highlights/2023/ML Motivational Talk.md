### **ML Motivational Talk**

Westwood Primary School is honoured to have Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Health and Ministry of Law as our invited speaker for our ML Motivational Talk on 12 July. Graduating ML pupils from our cluster schools attended the talk and had gained deep insights on self-motivation. The talk had definitely filled our young minds with emotions of positivity.
