### **ML Motivational Talk**

Westwood Primary School is honoured to have Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Health and Ministry of Law as our invited speaker for our ML Motivational Talk. Graduating ML pupils from our cluster schools attended the talk and had gained deep insights on self-motivation. Our pupils have benefited greatly from her sharing and are inspired to soar to greater heights.
