### **Math Sharing Exchange**

We are honored to play host to Ms Anna, an educator from Australia, who visited Westwood Primary on 21 February for a Math Sharing Exchange. We shared our best practices in the teaching of Mathematics. She also visited our classrooms to observe how we promote the joy of learning Mathematics among our pupils at different levels.
