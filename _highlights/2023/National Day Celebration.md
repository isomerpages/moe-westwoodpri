### **National Day Celebration**

On 8 August, our school commemorated National Day with a series of events. We commenced the day with engaging classroom activities, and later gathered in the hall for an enriching concert. The highlights of the concert included an observation ceremony, captivating performances by the choir members and pupils, and an interactive quiz designed to enhance our knowledge about Singapore. The atmosphere filled us all with joy and enthusiasm as we rejoiced in celebrating our nation's 58th birthday!
