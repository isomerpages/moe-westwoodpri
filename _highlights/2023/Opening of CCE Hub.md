### **CCE Hub Opening Ceremony**

Our CCE Hub is officially opened on 5 October and we are honoured to have Mr Kenneth Lim, our SAC Chairman to grace this meaningful occasion. Our CCE Hub is not merely a physical area; It is a haven where ideas, information, and inspiration converge. Pupil will be given the opportunities to express their thoughts about CCE-related matters, as well as to initiate and showcase their CCE-related works.
