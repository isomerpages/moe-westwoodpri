### **Overseas Visitors from MeriSTEM**

On 25 October, Westwood Primary hosted a group of STEM educators from Indonesia, including MOECRT officers, Master Teachers and University Faculty in teacher education, who were in Singapore for a STEM curriculum leadership programme. This programme is co-organised by Temasek Foundation, NIE/NTU by meriSTEM and Indonesia's Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Industry (MOECRT), which aims to develop STEM curriculum leadership of Indonesian STEM educators. 

The visitors were hosted by our teachers, who shared their experiences in carrying out Integrated STEM, and were assisted by capable and confident student facilitators. These student facilitators have demonstrated their inventive and creative thinking during the interaction segment. Students effectively communicated how they had worked in groups to design and create their proto-types. It has been a positive experience for everyone.
