### **P1 Orientation**

On November 17, we welcomed our 2024 P1 pupils and their parents to Westwood Primary for an orientation program to learn more about our school values and culture. A parent from our Parent Support Group shared valuable insights on easing her child's transition to Primary 1. To add a touch of inspiration to the event, our talented pupils captivated the audience with a delightful PAL dance and mesmerized everyone with their song-singing and piano performances.

Inside the classrooms, incoming P1 pupils actively participated in various engaging activities, from familiarizing themselves with classroom routines to practicing mindfulness exercises. Friendships blossomed as they got to know both their peers and caring teachers. Special commendation goes to our student leaders, who did a commendable job showcasing the warm and vibrant environment that defines our school. Here's to a promising and successful journey for our incoming P1 pupils!
