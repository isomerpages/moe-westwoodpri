Welcome, parents and pupils of the Class of 2024, to the P1 Orientation at our school! Today was an enriching experience for our new parents who gathered in the hall for a comprehensive briefing on our school's ethos, curriculum, and values. The invaluable insights shared by our dedicated Parent Support Group shed light on the seamless transition to P1, offering a wealth of practical advice and personal experiences. To add a touch of inspiration, our talented P2 pupils captivated the audience with a delightful PAL dance and a mesmerizing piano performance. Inside the classrooms, our incoming P1 pupils actively participated in various engaging activities, from familiarizing themselves with classroom routines to indulging in mindfulness exercises. Friendships blossomed as they got to know both their peers and caring teachers. Special commendation goes to our student leaders who did a commendable job showcasing the warm and vibrant environment that defines our school. Here's to a promising and successful journey for the Class of 2024!
