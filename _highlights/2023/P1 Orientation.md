### **P1 Orientation**

On November 17, we welcomed our 2024 P1 pupils and their parents to Westwood Primary for an orientation program to learn more about our school values and curriculum. A parent from our Parent Support Group shared valuable insights on helping her child to have a smooth transition to Primary 1. To add a touch of inspiration, our talented P2 pupils captivated the audience with a delightful PAL dance, and two of our pupils mesmerized everyone with their piano performance.

Inside the classrooms, our incoming P1 pupils actively participated in various engaging activities, from familiarizing themselves with classroom routines to indulging in mindfulness exercises. Friendships blossomed as they got to know both their peers and caring teachers. Special commendation goes to our student leaders, who did a commendable job showcasing the warm and vibrant environment that defines our school. Here's to a promising and successful journey for our incoming P1 pupils!
