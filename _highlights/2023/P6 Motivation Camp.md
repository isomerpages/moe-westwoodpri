### **P6 Motivation Camp**

Our 2023 P6 Motivational Camp was planned by our Alumni, who had put in lots of effort during their school holidays to plan, lead in the camp activities, as well as sharing of their personal experiences and strategies to their juniors in preparation for PSLE exam. We are very proud of our Alumni, who had planned such a wonderful learning experience for their juniors in Westwood Primary School. 

Other than our Alumni, we would also like to express our heartfelt thanks to our dedicated Parent Support Group who has supported us throughout the camp. May our P6 pupils continue to enjoy and embrace a growth mindset in their learning journey ahead!
