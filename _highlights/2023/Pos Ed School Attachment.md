### **Pos Ed School Attachment @WWPS**

Between 27th to 31st March, Westwood Primary School is honoured to have the opportunity to host a group of educators from different schools to share our Positive Education. In this one week, they have learned more about our Westwood's learning curriculum and environment through different classroom observations and sharing. Learning continues within the fraternity and we are always ready to share and learn from other fellow educators.
