### **Pos Ed Sharing**

Westwood Primary School shared our Positive Education practices with Ai Tong School and Pei Chun Public School on 2nd May. Ai Tong School also shared with us their Student Leadership programmes. It was an insightful sharing and we hope that this learning partnership can continue to benefit more educators in the fraternity.
