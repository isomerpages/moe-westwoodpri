### **School Tour by Student Leaders**

We have organized an exclusive tour for parents on 8th and 22nd May, led by our student leaders. Other than exploring our wonderful facilities, parents also had a dialogue session with our school leaders and student leaders to find out what makes learning so meaningful and enjoyable in Westwood Primary School.

**Objectives of the School Tour:**

* To introduce Westwood Primary School facilities and amenities for potential Primary One parents and students alike.

* To use this tour as a platform for parents to interact with Westwood Primary School students, teachers and school leaders.

* To advertise and promote Westwood Primary as a school of choice for kindergarten children who are enrolling into Primary One next year.

Due to overwhelming response, our school tour has been fully subscribed. We will share the photos taken during the school tour.
