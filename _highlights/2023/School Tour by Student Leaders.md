### **School Tour by Student Leaders**

We have organized an exclusive school tour for parents on 8th and 22nd May, led by our student leaders. Other than exploring our wonderful facilities, parents also had a dialogue session with our school leaders and student leaders to find out what makes learning so meaningful and enjoyable in Westwood Primary School.

**Objectives of the School Tour:**

* To introduce Westwood Primary School facilities and amenities for potential Primary One parents and students alike.

* To use this tour as a platform for parents to interact with Westwood Primary School students, teachers and school leaders.

* To advertise and promote Westwood Primary as a school of choice for kindergarten children who are enrolling into Primary One next year.

We are heartened that the recent kindergarten parent school tour led by our student leaders was a great success! Our wonderful student leaders were able to showcase our school to the parents with great confidence and professionalism. The parents were very satisfied with the tour and we are proud of our student leaders for their incredible efforts.
