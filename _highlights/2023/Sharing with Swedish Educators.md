On 11 April, we are honoured to host a group of educators from Sweden, who were here to learn about the Singapore school system and Mathematics curriculum. Our Principal Mr Mah walked them through our education system, followed by sharing on Mathematics curriculum. The Swedish educators also had an opportunity to observe our Math lessons at different levels.
