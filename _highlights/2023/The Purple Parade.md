### **The Purple Parade**

Westwood Primary supported The Purple Parade's campaign by setting up an encouragement corner during recess on 31 Oct and 1 Nov. Pupils engaged in blindfold activities to better understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities and wrote messages to promote inclusion in our community.
