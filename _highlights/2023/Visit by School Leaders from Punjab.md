### **Visit by School Leaders from Punjab, India**

On 26 July, a delegation of School Leaders from Punjab, India, paid a visit to Westwood Primary with the aim of gaining insights into our school's key programmes and learning environment. During their visit, our student leaders took them on a guided tour of the school. We feel privileged to have hosted them and had the opportunity to engage in an exchange of ideas on our education systems.
