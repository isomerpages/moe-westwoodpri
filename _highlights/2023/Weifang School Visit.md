### **Weifang China-Singapore Bilingual School Visit**

Students from Weifang China-Singapore Bilingual School (潍坊中新双语学校) in Shandong, China, visited Westwood Primary on 14 July to learn more about our school's culture and learning environment. Our P5 pupils played host to them, and they had a great time interacting in the classrooms and during recess. The visit concluded with a concert in the hall and a gift exchange among the students.
