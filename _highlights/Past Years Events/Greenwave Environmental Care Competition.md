### **Greenwave Environmental Care Competition**
The Greenwave Environmental Care Competition aims to inculcate awareness and motivate students to gain a sense of personal and group responsibility for their own environment and in the process, learn how to reason, think critically and act to protect it in a balanced way.&nbsp;Out of the four projects submitted by Green Club in 2016, we won two of them namely, “Who wants to be a Climate Change Millionaire?” (Third Prize) and Aromatic Egg Diffuser (Encouragement Award)
