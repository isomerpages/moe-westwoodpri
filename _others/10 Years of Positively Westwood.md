### **10 Years of Positively Westwood**
#### **Westwood Bilingual Publication ‘The Flourishing Pen’**
To commemorate Westwood Primary’s 10th anniversary, the English Department and the Mother Tongue Department collaborated to string together a bilingual compendium of poetry and prose titled, ‘The Flourishing Pen’. It consists of a broad range of entries based on our school Character Strengths. Our young writers have explored their boundaries of imagination and skillfully weaved in a plethora of rich vocabulary words into their entries. To mark this special edition, we have invited our Alumni (2018- 2021) to contribute their stories that echo the spirit of being Positively Westwood. Through this publication, we hope that our pupils will emulate the Character Strengths of having a resilient mindset, future-ready confidence, passion for community and above all, a heart full of gratitude. May your child cultivate the love of reading and writing at Westwood Primary!
