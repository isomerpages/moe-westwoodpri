### **Biodiversity @ Westwood Gardens**
Westwood Primary School takes pride in providing a thriving habitat for a variety of flora and fauna since 2013. We have photographed many species of organisms in the school over the years and have decided to feature them on this site. This diversity of flora and fauna has much to be treasured and everyone has a part to play in preserving them for our future generations. We hope that all stakeholders will benefit from the information shared and appreciate the importance of conserving wildlife in our ecosystem.
