### **High-5! Day: Celebrating 5 Years of Flourishing**
Westwood Primary School ended the last day of school on a high note with the celebration of the school's enriching 5 years as part of the Jurong West community. Teachers, parents and pupils were invited to write their personal character strengths on the acrylic hand prints which formed the longest acrylic hand prints making a new record in Singapore. The pupils also did the High-5 dance to celebrate the joyous occasion. The guest-of-honour, Dr Amy Khor, was here to grace the occasion and to mark the official opening of the school's Makerspace, a space for our pupils to create new things using their imagination. Staff and pupils also received the year book which depicts the school's 5-year journey. It was indeed a memorable day for all of us.
