### **ICT Baseline & PW**
**Showcasing of Pupils' Work for ICT Baseline Standard Literacy Programme and Project Work**

<img src="/images/ict%20baseline%201.png" style="width:85%">

Our Baseline ICT Standard Literacy Programme and Project Work aim to equip every Westwood pupil with the essential ICT skills for the 21st Century, to become self-directed and collaborative learners. We will be showcasing our pupils’ work by levels via this Google Site. You are strongly encouraged to take a look at your child’s/ward’s work and write some “Words of Encouragement” for him/her using the Padlet links. We hope this will help parents better understand their child/ward’s learning in school. Partner us in nurturing our pupils to be future-ready and anchor-steady.
