### **Secondary School Matters**
Moving from Primary to Secondary School is a huge milestone for both pupils and parents.

As parents, we can be better prepared by finding out the subjects that your child/ward will be taking in Secondary School and help your child be prepared for the transition. We will work closely with your child/ward in the transition and update you with regards to Secondary school matters from time to time.

Under this tab, we will update matters on Direct School Admission, Open House for Secondary Schools, Secondary 1 Posting etc.

#### **Direct School Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec)**
Primary 6 (P6) students can seek admission to certain secondary schools based on their talent in sports, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and specific academic areas. Learn more about DSA-Sec by clicking [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa).

#### **Secondary 1 Posting**
Most students are placed in secondary schools through the S1 posting process, which takes place once the PSLE results are released. Click [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting) to learn more about the process.

#### **WE STories**
Welcome to browse through this issue of WE STories, a collection of stories from secondary, specialised and specialised independent schools in the West Zone. Through these narratives, we hope to provide fresh insights on the endeavours of each school and its teachers in delivering student centric, values driven education and partnership with the community to create authentic learning experiences for the secondary students. The stories will be helpful to teachers and parents in guiding primary school pupils in choosing schools that can cater to their interests and strengths.
