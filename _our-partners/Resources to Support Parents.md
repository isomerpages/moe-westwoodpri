### **Parenting Support Programme**
The Parenting Support Programme (PSP) is an initiative by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to support families in the holistic development of school students.  Westwood Primary School embarked on this programme in 2020 with the Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society (THK@Jurong) as our service provider.  The Family Services Division of THK@Jurong has since availed family and parenting programmes for all our parents.  These include the evidence-based Triple P and Signpost parenting programmes and help for families in need of additional support and care.  Parents can link up directly with them if need to. Please refer to the poster for more information.
