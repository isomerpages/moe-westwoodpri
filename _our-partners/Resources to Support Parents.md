### **Parenting Support Programme**
The Parenting Support Programme (PSP) is an initiative by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to support families in the holistic development of school students.&nbsp; Westwood Primary School embarked on this programme in 2020 with the Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society (THK@Jurong) as our service provider.&nbsp; The Family Services Division of THK@Jurong has since availed family and parenting programmes for all our parents.&nbsp; These include the evidence-based Triple P and Signpost parenting programmes and help for families in need of additional support and care.&nbsp; Parents can link up directly with them if need to. Please refer to the poster for more information.

### **Ways To Boost Your Child’s Well-Being**

 A child’s holistic well-being is important to support their overall development and learning. Children with high levels of well-being will be better able to face and overcome the various challenges that life may bring. They will also be better able to build positive relationships with other children, adults and the community as a whole. Therefore, we have compiled an array of resources that will be useful in enhancing and strengthening parents’ knowledge and skills to boost and support our children’s well-being. We hope that these resources will be beneficial in helping parents to build their children’s resilience and overall cognitive, emotional and social well-being.
