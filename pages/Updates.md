### **Updates**
Ground laying works for the OEL corners carried on during the December break. We were back after the holidays and voila! The almost completed infrastructure for the four sites. Moving on to stage two now in the new year in preparation for the planting, selection and growing of plants for the various themed gardens and most importantly, designing and developing the "heartware" - teaching and learning curriculum packages.  It's a journey we embark on for our children's learning.
